					<h4 class="activity"> Tin Foil Boats </h4>
					<p> Dive into engineering and the engineering design process by building tin foil boats that can hold a heavy load of coins. We will discuss both the success and challenges of their first prototype before students get to test and build a second version of their tin foil boat. </p>

					<h4 class="activity"> Battery Powered LEDs </h4>
					<p> Our first adventure into electronics - no computer necessary. We will be learning the basics of building circuits using a 9V battery, some LEDs (light emitting diodes) and a breadboard. Some questions we will answer: How do breadboards work? Why are some of the lights brighter than others? What's the importance of the positive and negative in a circuit?

					<h4 class="activity"> Secret Messages: Morse Code </h4>
					<p>Now that we can light LEDS up, can we use them to send secret messages? After experimenting with just using the battery and LEDs to send messages, we'll bring the Arduino and a button into the circuit to improve our secret message sending.
